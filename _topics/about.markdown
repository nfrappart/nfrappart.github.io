I’m Nathanael (Nate) Frappart, a Cloud Infrastructure Architect and co-founder of Ryzhom. Over the past five years, I’ve specialized in Azure and HashiCorp technologies, focusing on scalable, secure cloud infrastructure and automation. As a HashiCorp Ambassador (2023-2024) and co-organizer of the HashiCorp User Group in Paris, I actively contribute to the tech community, sharing insights and experiences. I’m also an occasional conference speaker, driven by a passion for knowledge sharing and innovation in cloud solutions.
