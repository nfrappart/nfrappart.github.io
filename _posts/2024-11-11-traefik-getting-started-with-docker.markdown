# 1- Introduction
I recently decided to revisit local labs. The motivation was simple: it's free compared to cloud hosted resources, which makes it more suitable for educational content. Also I happened to get myself without Internet connection (hello airplane!) which renders cloud hosted labs unusable. Finally, working on an ARM based macbook, VM is not really viable anymore.
This particular topic still require Internet connectivity at some point, but not most of the time.
